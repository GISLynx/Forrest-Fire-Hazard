<h1>Forest Fire Hazard</h1>

 ### Summary of my independet study

<h2>Description</h2>
Forest fires occur every year in Spain, causing extensive economic and
biodiversity damage. Thanks to advancements in technology, there is a multitude of
tools in geographic information systems to analyze specific factors connected to the
ignition and spread of forest fires. In this way, the government can take action to
prevent them.
The following project analyzes different variables related to hazard and vulnerability to
determine the risk of forest fires in the municipality of Hinojosa del Duque.
Understanding the characteristics of the forest mass and how human activities are
involved helps determine the risk this municipality could face. Therefore, using GIS and
various statistical processes, it is possible to identify the most problematic areas and
allocate resources to prevent the highest possible damage
