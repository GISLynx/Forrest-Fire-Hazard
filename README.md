<h1>Forest Fire Hazard</h1>

 ### Summary of my independet study

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Forest fires occur every year in Spain, causing extensive economic and
biodiversity damage. Thanks to advancements in technology, there is a multitude of
tools in geographic information systems to analyze specific factors connected to the
ignition and spread of forest fires. In this way, the government can take action to
prevent them.
The following project analyzes different variables related to hazard and vulnerability to
determine the risk of forest fires in the municipality of Hinojosa del Duque.
Understanding the characteristics of the forest mass and how human activities are
involved helps determine the risk this municipality could face. Therefore, using GIS and
various statistical processes, it is possible to identify the most problematic areas and
allocate resources to prevent the highest possible damage
</p>


<h2>Languages and software Used</h2>

- <p>ARCGIS</p> 
+ <p>QGIS</p>
* <p>Python</p>
- <p>Excel</p>

<h2>Metodology</h2>
<p>The goal of this metodology  is to create cartography related to the risk of forrest fire in Hinojosa del Duque, Cordoba, Spain. To do so, I have created a model on ARCGIS Desktop using different variable based on <a href="https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/medioambiente/portal/landing-page-publicacion/-/asset_publisher/FytOUWH22K7t/content/plan-infoca.-un-plan-de-acci-c3-b3n-al-servicio-del-monte-mediterr-c3-a1neo-andaluz-2003-/20151">INFOCA PLAN</a></p>

<h3>hazard of forest fire</h3>

<p>INFOCA PLAN describe the hazard in two different variables. The first one is related to the long term danger and the second one to short term.In this case I focused on the long term variables, those ones talks about the combustibility of the vegetation and the slope, which promote convective currents. For the vulnerability I created two variables based on two different point of view. The first one consist on the human value over monetary values of objects; houses, famrs, historical site, protected area, etc. At the end I used the data of the hazard and vulnerability to know the risk of forrest fires in Hinojosa del Duque. </p>

<b>Caluclating hazard:</b>
 
<p align="justify" font-weight: normal > To calculate the danger of forrest fire, INFOCA PLAN describe a metodology called structural hazard which describe the hazard in the long term. This structural hazard is based on the combination of two different variables, which is been implemented on ARCGIS Desktop </p>
